## <a id="basic-integration">Basic integration

We will describe the steps to integrate the adjust SDK into your Cocos2d-x Windows or Windows Phone project.

### <a id="sdk-get">Get the SDK

Download the latest version from our [releases page][releases]. Extract the archive into a directory of your choice.

### <a id="sdk-add">Add the SDK to your project

Take the `Adjust` folder and copy it to your project's `Classes` folder.  Add it, along with all the files inside, to your 
Visual Studio project as part of the `Classes` folder.

![][add_windows_files]

### <a id="sdk-winrt">Add adjust Windows Runtime Component project to your solution

The project which Cocos2d-x generated for you is unmanaged and written in pure C++. Our Windows SDK is managed and written in 
C#. In order to facilitate communication between your unmanaged app and our managed SDK, we created a Windows Runtime 
Component project that can be added to your app as a reference. It wraps our Windows SDK and can be used with unmanaged C++ 
code.

Depending on the platform you are building your app for, you should choose the appropriate Windows Runtime Component project
to add to your solution. The Windows Runtime Component projects can be found in `Windows` folder. You can choose one of the 
following projects:

* `AdjustUAP10WinRT` - Use this if you are developing your app for Windows 10
* `AdjustWP81WinRT` - Use this if you are developing your app for Windows Phone 8.1
* `AdjustWS81WinRT` - Use this if you are developing your app for Windows 8.1

![][add_winrt_project]

After you have added one of these projects to your solution, add the reference to it in your app's project.

![][add_winrt_project_reference]

By completing this step, you have successfully added the adjust Cocos2d-x SDK for Windows into your Visual Studio project.

### <a id="sdk-integrate">Integrate the SDK into your app

In the Project Navigator, open the source file of your application delegate. Add the import statement at the top of the file. 
Next, add the following call to Adjust in the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` of your app delegate:

```cpp
#include "Adjust/Adjust2dx.h"

// ...

std::string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
std::string environment = AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx;

AdjustConfig2dx adjustConfig = AdjustConfig2dx(appToken, environment);

Adjust2dx::start(adjustConfig);
```

![][add_adjust2dx]

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your app token. You can find this in your [dashboard].

Depending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must set `environment` with one of these values:

```cpp
std::string environment = AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx;
std::string environment = AdjustEnvironmentProduction2dx;
```

**Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx` if and only if you or someone else is testing your 
app. Make sure to set the environment to `AdjustEnvironmentProduction2dx` just before you publish the app. Set it back to
`AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx` when you start developing and testing it again.

We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic from test devices. It is very important that you 
keep this value meaningful at all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.

### <a id="sdk-logging">Adjust logging

To see the compiled logs from our library in `released` mode, it is necessary to redirect the log output to your app while 
it's being tested in `debug` mode.

In order to do this, set your custom method which is going to handle log output and set it on the config object as the second 
parameter of the `setLogLevel` method. Method should be defined with no return value (void) and it should get one parameter of 
`const char*` type.

```cpp
#include "Adjust/Adjust2dx.h"

// ...

static void printLog(const char* logLine) {
    std::string logLineAsString(logLine);
    CCLog(logLineAsString.c_str());
}

//...

std::string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
std::string environment = AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx;

AdjustConfig2dx adjustConfig = AdjustConfig2dx(appToken, environment);
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxVerbose, printLog);

Adjust2dx::start(adjustConfig);
// ...
```

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see in tests by calling `setLogLevel` on your `AdjustConfig2dx` instance 
with one of the following parameters as the first method parameter:

```cpp
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxVerbose, printLog); // enable all logging
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxDebug, printLog);   // enable more logging
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxInfo, printLog);    // the default
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxWarn, printLog);    // disable info logging
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxError, printLog);   // disable warnings as well
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxAssert, printLog);  // disable errors as well
```

### <a id="sdk-build">Build your app

Build and run your app. If the build succeeds, you should carefully read the SDK logs in the console. After the app launched 
for the first time, you should see the info log `Install tracked`.

![][run]

## <a id="additional-features">Additional features

Once you integrate the adjust SDK into your project, you can take advantage of the following features.

### <a id="event-tracking">Event tracking

With adjust, you can track every event that you want. Suppose you want to track every tap on a button. Simply create a new 
event token in your [dashboard]. Let's say that event token is `abc123`. You can add the following line in your button’s click
handler method to track the click:

```cpp
AdjustEvent2dx adjustEvent = AdjustEvent2dx("abc123");
Adjust2dx::trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

When this event is triggered, you should see `Event tracked` in the logs.

The event instance can be used to configure the event further before tracking
it.

### <a id="revenue-tracking">Revenue tracking

If your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making In-App Purchases, then you can track those revenues 
with events. Let's say a tap is worth €0.01. You could track the revenue event like this:

```cpp
AdjustEvent2dx adjustEvent = AdjustEvent2dx("abc123");

adjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, "EUR");

Adjust2dx::trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

When you set a currency token, adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues into a reporting revenue of your 
choice. Read more about [currency conversion here][currency-conversion].

You can read more about revenue and event tracking in the [event tracking guide][event-tracking].

### <a id="callback-parameters">Callback parameters

You can register a callback URL for your events in your [dashboard]. We will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event 
is tracked. You can add callback parameters to that event by calling `addCallbackParameter` on the event before tracking it. 
We will then append these parameters to your callback URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL `http://www.adjust.com/callback` for your event with event token `abc123`
and execute the following lines:

```cpp
AdjustEvent2dx adjustEvent = AdjustEvent2dx("abc123");

adjustEvent.addCallbackParameter("key", "value");
adjustEvent.addCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust2dx::trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

In that case, we would track the event and send a request to:

```
http://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar
```

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}` that can be used as parameter values. In the 
resulting callback this placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current device. Also note that we 
don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an 
event, these parameters won't even be read.

You can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in our 
[callbacks guide][callbacks-guide].

### <a id="partner-parameters">Partner parameters

You can also add parameters to be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your 
adjust dashboard.

This works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can be added by calling the `addPartnerParameter` method 
on your `AdjustEvent2dx` instance.

```cpp
AdjustEvent2dx adjustEvent = AdjustEvent2dx("abc123");

adjustEvent.addPartnerParameter("key", "value");
adjustEvent.addPartnerParameter("foo", "bar");

Adjust2dx::trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

You can read more about special partners and these integrations in our [guide to special partners][special-partners].

### <a id="attribution-callback">Attribution callback

adjust can also send you a callback upon change of attribution. Due to the different sources considered for attribution, this 
information cannot be provided synchronously. Follow these steps to implement the optional callback in your application:

1. Create void method which receives parameter of type `AdjustAttribution2dx`.

2. After creating instance of `AdjustConfig2dx`, call its `setAttributionCallback` method with the previously created method 
   as parameter.

The callback function will get called when the SDK receives final attribution data. Within the callback function you have 
access to the `attribution` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its properties:

- `std::string trackerToken` the tracker token of the current install.
- `std::string trackerName` the tracker name of the current install.
- `std::string network` the network grouping level of the current install.
- `std::string campaign` the campaign grouping level of the current install.
- `std::string adgroup` the ad group grouping level of the current install.
- `std::string creative` the creative grouping level of the current install.
- `std::string clickLabel` the click label of the current install.

```cpp
#include "Adjust/Adjust2dx.h"

//...

static void attributionCallbackMethod(AdjustAttribution2dx attribution) {
    // Printing all attribution properties.
    CCLOG("\nAttribution changed!");
    CCLOG("\nTracker token: %s", attribution.getTrackerToken().c_str());
    CCLOG("\nTracker name: %s", attribution.getTrackerName().c_str());
    CCLOG("\nNetwork: %s", attribution.getNetwork().c_str());
    CCLOG("\nCampaign: %s", attribution.getCampaign().c_str());
    CCLOG("\nAdgroup: %s", attribution.getAdgroup().c_str());
    CCLOG("\nCreative: %s", attribution.getCreative().c_str());
    CCLOG("\nClick label: %s", attribution.getClickLabel().c_str());
    CCLOG("\n");
}

// ...

bool AppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching() {
    std::string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
    std::string environment = AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx;

    AdjustConfig2dx adjustConfig = AdjustConfig2dx(appToken, environment);
    adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxVerbose);
    adjustConfig.setAttributionCallback(attributionCallbackMethod);
    
    Adjust2dx::start(adjustConfig);

    // ...
}
```

Please make sure to consider [applicable attribution data policies][attribution-data].

### <a id="disable-tracking">Disable tracking

You can disable the adjust SDK from tracking by invoking the method `Adjust2dx::setEnabled` with the enabled parameter as
`false`. This setting is **remembered between sessions**, but it can only be activated after the first session.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::setEnabled(false);
```

You can verify if the adjust SDK is currently active with the method `Adjust2dx::isEnabled()`. It is always possible to 
activate the adjust SDK by invoking `Adjust2dx::setEnabled` with the parameter set to `true`.

### <a id="offline-mode">Offline mode

You can put the adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers while retaining tracked data to be sent
later. When in offline mode, all information is saved in a file, so be careful not to trigger too many events while in
offline mode.

You can activate offline mode by calling `Adjust2dx::setOfflineMode` with the parameter `true`.

```cpp
Adjust2dx::setOfflineMode(true);
```

Conversely, you can deactivate offline mode by calling `Adjust2dx::setOfflineMode` with `false`. When the adjust SDK is put 
back in online mode, all saved information is send to our servers with the correct time information.

Unlike disabling tracking, **this setting is not remembered** between sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode
whenever it is started, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.

### <a id="event-buffering">Event buffering

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch
every minute. You can enable event buffering with your `AdjustConfig2dx` instance by calling `setEventBufferingEnabled` 
method:

```cpp
// ...

bool AppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching() {
    std::string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
    std::string environment = AdjustEnvironmentSandbox2dx;

    AdjustConfig2dx adjustConfig = AdjustConfig2dx(appToken, environment);
    adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel2dxVerbose);
    adjustConfig.setEventBufferingEnabled(true);
    
    Adjust2dx::start(adjustConfig);

    // ...
}
```

If nothing set, event buffering is **disabled by default**.
